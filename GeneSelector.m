function [E_red,C_red,nGen,reduced_gene_names] = GeneSelector(genevct,voxvgene,gene_names,ngen_param,lambda,method,preloadinds)
% Function that performs various types of subset selection implemented in
% Mezias et al, 2020, including the ideal method MRx3. The user MUST supply
% the following inputs:
% genevct - a scRNAseq-based expression matrix that is genes x cell types
% in dimension (output of ProcessedData_Generator.m)
% voxvgene - an ISH-based expression matrix that is voxels x genes in
% dimension (output of ProcessedData_Generator.m)
% gene_names - a genes x 1 cell array of gene names (output of 
% ProcessedData_Generator.m) 
% ngen_param - integer, definition depends on subsetting method For mRMR,
% MRx3, and colAMD, ngen_param is the size of the target gene set. For 
% Entropy, it is  the threshold entropy value above which genes are not
% selected. For DBSCAN, it is the value of the neighborhood search radius. 
% For Zeisel, it is the number of genes to select per cell type. 
%
% The user may also choose to supply:
% lambda - MRx3-specific parameter that controls the relative weighting of
% gene projection error; if not provided, set to 150
% method - string specifying the subset selection method; if not provided,
% set to MRx3
% preloadinds - a 1 x length(gene_names) numeric array of indices for the
% gene order of a given subset method. It is more computationally efficient
% for parameter sweeps of MRx3 to determine the order of the genes selected
% across all genes in gene_names and then subset based on the first
% ngen_param entries of the list, as opposed to calling MRx3_Selector many
% times. This is unnecessary but would still work in principle for any of
% the other gene selection methods as well. In this case the ngen_param the
% user supplies should serve the same function as if they were performing
% MRx3, mRMR, or colAMD.
%
% The outputs are:
% E_red - reduced genes x voxels expression matrix
% C_red - reduced genes x cell types expression matrix
% nGen - number of genes in the reduced set
% reduced_gene_names - reduced genes x 1 cell array of gene names for the 
% reduced set

% Default option is MRx3 with lambda = 150
